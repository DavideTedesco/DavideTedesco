### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Davide Tedesco, after the first Degree obtained in Elctronic Music with the maximum marks at the Conservatory of Rome, Santa Cecilia, i decided to begin in parallel with the Diploma of specialisation at the Conservatory, a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Roma Tre. 

  I am interested and passionate about the technological sphere, sports, reading books, arts and nature.

Here's [my website](https://www.davidetedesco.it/) where I occasionally write random stuff.

### Here are some stats ðŸ“ˆ
