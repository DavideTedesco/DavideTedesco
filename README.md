### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Davide Tedesco, after the first Diploma obtained with the maximum marks at he Conservatory of Rome, Santa Cecila, i decided to begin in parallel with the Diploma of specialisation at the Conservatory, a Computer Science degree at the University of Roma Tre. I am interested and passionate about all the technological sphere, sports, reading books, arts and nature.

Here's [my website](https://www.davidetedesco.it/) where I occasionally write random stuff.
